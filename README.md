# Data Table

## Short description:

This repo is made for helping the developers to make tabe
with navigation options including: **moving forward**, **moving backward** and **data counter**.

## How to use it?

Well it's not that complicated repo, it's just a work that could take 3 hours from you of brainstorming and testing...etc. You can clone it and then run the _index.html_ file and then you will notice everything.

## How does it work?

It has a variable called Data and it kinda uses it as fetched data from an API and then you can see the **generateTable()** function which does it all

PS : Don't forget to star the repo if it helped you ^\_^.
